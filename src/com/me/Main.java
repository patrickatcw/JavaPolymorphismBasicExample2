/*
- create a base class called car
- it should have a few fields that would be appropriate for a generic
car class; engine, cylinders, wheels, etc.
- constructor should initialize # of cylinders and name, and set wheels to 4
and engine to true. cylinders and names would be passed parameters
- create appropriate getters
- create some methods like startEngine, accelerate, and brake; show a
message for each in the base class
- now create 3 sub classes for your favorite vehicles
- override the appropriate methods to demonstrate polymorphism in use
- put all classes in the one java file, like this one we are in now!
